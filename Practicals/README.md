# Practicals for IT@JCU CP1404/CP1804/CP5632

This repository contains Python code and instructions for practicals for the subjects CP1404, CP1804 and CP5632 at James Cook University.

Many files contain `# TODO` comments, which are part of the instructions for what students need to do.  
Complete instructions are found in each prac folder.

## Solutions
Selected practical solutions are provided here, in the **"solutions"** branch.  
These are to help you learn by evaluating your own work and seeing our suggested ways of solving the practical problems. 

**Important**: Please use the solutions in a mature and honest way, as helpful learning tools... _after_ you complete your own work, _not_ as something to simply copy into your own prac work. OK?  
Seriously, **never copy the solutions** as this will not help you learn as much as doing your own coding.

## Practical Content
Practical numbers do not necessarily correspond to weeks.
E.g. some subject offerings run in 10 weeks, some in 13 weeks.
